... still under construction ... (feel free to propose materials, `bitsandbytes` is a community project)

## Setup

### Setup pre-commit hooks
- Install pre-commit hooks with `pip install pre-commit`.
- Run `pre-commit autoupdate` once to configure the hooks.
- Re-run `pre-commit autoupdate` every time a new hook got added.

Now all the pre-commit hooks will be automatically run when you try to commit and if they introduce some changes, you need to re-add the changed files before being able to commit and push.

### Ignore formatting revs
- Run `git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs`. This will make it so that `git blame` is aware of commits that were logged to be solely formatting-related.

## Doc-string syntax

We're following NumPy doc-string conventions with the only notable difference being that we use Markdown instead of Rich text format (RTF) for markup within the doc-strings.

Please see the existing documentation to see how to generate autodocs.
