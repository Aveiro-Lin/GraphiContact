# 8-bit quantization

[LLM.int8()](https://hf.co/papers/2208.07339) is a quantization method that doesn't degrade performance which makes large model inference more accessible. The key is to extract the outliers from the inputs and weights and multiply them in 16-bit. All other values are multiplied in 8-bit and quantized to Int8 before being dequantized back to 16-bits. The outputs from the 16-bit and 8-bit multiplication are combined to produce the final output.
